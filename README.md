# Propaganda Detection and Classification by 2 Approaches
People’s minds have frequently been changed by different propaganda techniques, especially after the development of technology. People expose vast amounts of propaganda content without notice. However, it can lead to serious consequences due to people's actions. Different techniques such as LLMs (Large Language Models) have been used in recent years thanks to the great progress in NLP (Natural Language Processing). I divided the main task into 2 tasks detection of propaganda and classification of it. Also, 2 different approaches were used. The first one was Bag of Words (BoW) with a Multinomial Naïve Bayes Classifier. The second is BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). While BoW was more successful in detecting propaganda (Task 1), BERT overcame it better in propaganda classification (Task 2).
